<p>This project was completed through Udacity's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002">Data Analyst Nanodegree</a>&nbsp;certification.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>The project conducted A/B testing of user conversions on an old and new webpage.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read data into a pandas Dataframe</li>
<li>Handle Mismatched and duplicate records.</li>
<li>Preform hypothesis, bootstrapping, Z-test and logistic regression.</li>
<li>Determine if our P values are significant enough for further investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tech</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, StatsModels</li>
<li>LaTex</li>
<li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>None of the variables have significant p-values.</li>
<li>We will fail to reject the null.</li>
<li>Not enough evidence to claim interaction between country and page received that on the basis of country there are more conversions.</li>
<li>Everything appears to be working just fine, don&rsquo;t fix what is not broken.</li>
</ul>
