Overview
The project conducted A/B testing of user conversions on an old and new webpage.
Procedure:
•	Read data into a pandas Dataframe
•	Handle Mismatched and duplicate records.
•	Preform hypothesis, bootstrapping, Z-test and logistic regression.
•	Determine if our P values are significant enough for further investigation.
Tech
•	Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, StatsModels
•	LaTex
•	Jupyter Notebook
Key Findings
•	None of the variables have significant p-values.
•	We will fail to reject the null.
•	Not enough evidence to claim interaction between country and page received that on the basis of country there are more conversions.
•	Everything appears to be working just fine, don’t fix what is not broken.
